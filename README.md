 🌤️ Weather Data Analysis Project

## 📁 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset to extract insights and patterns from historical weather data. The dataset includes various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather conditions.

## 🧾 Dataset

* **File name:** `Project 1 - Weather Dataset.csv`
* **Source:** Assumed to be publicly available or academic dataset
* **Rows:** *\[you can tell me or I’ll calculate it if needed]*
* **Columns:** Date/Time, Temperature, Dew Point, Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, Weather Condition, etc.

## 📌 Objectives

* Understand the structure and key components of the weather dataset
* Clean and preprocess the data
* Perform descriptive statistical analysis
* Visualize weather trends and distributions
* Answer key business/analytical questions

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

* Most frequent weather condition
* Distribution of temperature and humidity
* Weather conditions for specific wind speeds or temperature thresholds
* Correlation between visibility, humidity, and pressure
* Time-based trends in weather (daily, monthly)

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

*(You can insert matplotlib/seaborn plots as images or links here later)*

* Histogram of temperature distribution
* Time series line plots of weather conditions
* Correlation heatmaps

## 🧠 Insights

* Clear weather was the most frequent condition recorded
* Strong correlation observed between humidity and dew point
* Visibility dropped significantly during fog or snow
* Temperatures showed seasonal variation across the dataset period

Would you like me to include actual numbers, questions answered, or specific visuals if you’ve already analyzed the dataset? I can also generate Python code for the EDA if you haven’t done it yet.
